As it always goes with open source, you are welcome to use SODAH-RATING free of charge. If you are using and enjoying my work, maybe you could buy me a beer (or if you don’t drink – a coffee and bagel will do just fine, a good kind of bagel though, you know… with wonderful stuff inside to make it glorious, like smoked salmon and creamcheese… not just butter).
